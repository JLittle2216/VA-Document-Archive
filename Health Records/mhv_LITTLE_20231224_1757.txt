        Indicate method used to obtain medical information to complete this
        document:
        
        [X] Review of available records (without in-person or video telehealth
            examination) using the Acceptable Clinical Evidence (ACE) process
            because the existing medical evidence provided sufficient 
information
            on which to prepare the questionnaire and such an examination will
            likely provide no additional relevant evidence.

    MEDICAL OPINION SUMMARY
    -----------------------
    
        DIAGNOSIS: 
        Bilateral Pes Planus -M21.4


        Does the Veteran have a diagnosis of toe(s) that is at least as likely as 

        not (likelihood is at least approximately balanced or nearly equal, if
        not 
        higher) incurred in or caused by (the) sprained toes during service?

        Yes, Veteran reports LEFT GREAT TOE pain since his injury during active
        duty service. Noted in November 9, 2006 is toe strain. He had tenderness
        on exam.
        It is at least as likely as not that his current left toe pain is a
        continuation of left toe pain incurred in AD service.
